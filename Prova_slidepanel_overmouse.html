  <div id="panel">From now, Sliding Panel can be finely positionned. The position parameter determines on which side of your container the panel will be.
    <br>The offset parameter allows you to fine tune the position, relatively to the sides you wish. You could, for example, use position: 'right' and offset: {top: '100px'} to make it appear on the right side, 100px from the top. Have a try !</div>
